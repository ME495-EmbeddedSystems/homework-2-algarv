__pycache__ does not belong in git repository -0.1

Part I
trajectory node
1. Publishes cmd_vel at fixed frequency
2. Broadcasts static transform from world -> odom
3. pause service
4. resume service
5. Parameters:
   width height period ~pub_freq

Instead of an if statement and two publishers, you should publish on /cmd_vel and
<remap> topics appropriately in the launchfile. -0.2

simodom
1. turtlesim/Pose subscriber
2. nav_msgs/Odometry publisher
3. odom->base_footprint broadcaster
4. Frames oriented correctly


src/homework2 python package
- Computes the trajectory properly
- Calculations are shown
[use docstrings rather than comments for each of your functions] -0.1

catkin_make run_tests
- Proper tests provided
[one of the tests fails] -0.1
[Yes, you almost never compare  floating point numbers directly, often you
check that they are within an espilon of each other.
python provides an assertAlmostEqual for this purpose

Part II
twoarm.urdf.xacro
    - uses lengths from config/arm/yaml.
arm_basics.launch
    - works and visualizes the robot
arm_traj
    - makes arm follow trajectory
arm_marker:
    properly displays the markers
arm_mark.launch
    - uses include tag
